🏦 Bank Chat Bot

This project is a simple rule-based chatbot built in Python (Jupyter Notebook) that simulates basic bank interactions. It uses functions (def), conditional statements (if-elif-else), and the time library to create an interactive conversation experience.

🚀 Features

● Greets users and simulates banking conversations.

● Provides basic details like account number, balance, IFSC code, and account type.

● Uses time.sleep() for realistic response delays.

● Built entirely with Python fundamentals (no external ML or NLP libraries).

⚙️ Tech Stack

● Python

● Jupyter Notebook

● time library

💡 How It Works

● The bot asks the user for input.

● Based on keywords (like balance, account, IFSC), it responds with relevant details.

● Uses if, elif, and else to decide the response.

● Exits when the user types "exit" or "quit".
 

🎯 Applications

Beginner project for learning Python basics.

Great for practicing functions, conditionals, and user input handling.

Can be extended into a full banking assistant with databases and APIs.
